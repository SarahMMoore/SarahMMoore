## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>Hi! I'm Sarah Moore.</p> 
<p>I retired from working as an Office Admin for CPA firms in 2019 and bought an RV with my then boyfriend, now husband, Bobby. We traveled for 5 years before buying a home last January in Carlinville, IL.</p>
<p>I went back to school a few years ago and attended Illinois College. I took a publishing course and needed to set-up a blog/website for a project. I enjoyed creating the site so much I wanted to learn more. IC didn't have the program I wanted, so I transfered to Arizona State University, where I now study Graphic Information Technology.</p>
